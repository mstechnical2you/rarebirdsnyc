                        <p>This is a baby Brown Squawker. It will let you know where it is. They like tall buildings and can often be seen perched high on the walls of Yankee Stadium. They can't be silenced. You will just have to wait for the season to end.</p>

                        <p>A shrewd bird indeed, is the Blue Cowled Prowler. It knows where to find other birds' nests and empty them of all things good. They are quick and fleet of foot. Try to spot them in Prospect Park.</p>

                        <p>The Purple Quilled Mallard was hunted almost to extinction for its quills used in the UK to write purple-poison-pen letters. The "Malicious Communications Act 1988" spared them further demise. Look for them in Jamaica Bay. </p>
