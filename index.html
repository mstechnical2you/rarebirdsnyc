				    <h2> Bird Watching Facts</h2>
				
			        <p>Birdwatching, or birding, is a popular activity in New York City. It can be done with the naked eye, although binoculars are best. 
			        There are many parks in the city and we have identified some of them that seem most attractive to certain birds. They are all accessible by the Subway system. 
			        We do ask that you try not to disturb them, as they are rare and this is a part of their annual pilgrimage across the globe.</p>

			        <p>The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food and hats) value is traced to the late 18th century in 
			         It was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds.
			         The Audubon Society was started to protect birds from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.</p>
			        
			        <p>What rare birds you may find in a given park depend on the season. Click on each season to see what rare birds are spotted during Summer, Winter, Fall and Spring. 
			        Their names and habits are sure to surprise you and make you chuckle too!</p>

                        <p>The Blue and Yellow Flasher is noted for the dramatic display of its striking undercarriage. It can sometimes be found in "The Rambles" in Central Park during the Summer months. </p>

                        <p>The lonely male Buzzed Owl seems to have trouble finding a mate. It's numbers are dwindling rapidly. Summers, it can still be found cruising in the North Bronx. </p>

                        <p>The Meadowlark Lemon is truly a globetrotter. It travels nearly 6,000 miles each year just to spend July and August in the meadows of Central Park.</p>
