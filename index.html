				<h2> Bird Watching Facts</h2>
				
			        <p>Birdwatching, or birding, is a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity. 
			        It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes, by listening for bird sounds,
			        or by watching public webcams. Birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more easily 
			        detected and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, 
			        who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods.
			        
			        <p>The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food) value is traced to the late 18th century in 
			        the works of Gilbert White, Thomas Bewick, George Montagu and John Clare.[7] The study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly 
			        prevalent in Britain during the Victorian Era, often associated with collection, eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest. 
			        Wealthy collectors made use of their contacts in the colonies to obtain specimens from around the world. It was only in the late 19th century that 
			        the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds. The Audubon Society was started to protect birds 
			        from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.</p>

			        Their names and habits are sure to surprise you and make you chuckle too!</p>
