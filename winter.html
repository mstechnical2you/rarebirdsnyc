                        <p>The Australian Steelback travels the furthest of all winter birds. The worst part is, it was Winter when it left it's home! Poor thing. Found in Forest Park.</p>

                        <p>Beware the Blue Bomber! It strikes from on high, shrieking all the while. You can imagine why they are becoming even rarer. Nobody likes them.</p>

                        <p>The Pink Pudge just doesn't care. If you are lucky enough to find one, don't hurry. It isn't moving before Spring. Look in Prospect Park.</p>
